# cryptator3001.1

Cryptator3001.1 is a tool designed for securely encrypting, decrypting, and hashing passwords. The goal is to provide a reliable way to handle sensitive information for secure storage and integrity verification.
Features:
- Caesar: Encrypt or decrypt messages by shifting letters by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet.
- Vigenere: Use a keyword to encrypt or decrypt messages with a polyalphabetic substitution cipher.
- Polybe: Encode messages into pairs of coordinates using a grid-based substitution cipher.
- LFSR (Linear Feedback Shift Register): Generate pseudo-random numbers or encrypt data by shifting bits with feedback.
- RC4 (Rivest Cipher 4): Stream cipher that generates a pseudo-random bit stream for fast encryption and decryption.
- MD5 (Message Digest 5): Generate an MD5 hash for verifying the integrity of passwords.
- SHA-256 (Secure Hash Algorithm 256-bit): Generate a 256-bit cryptographic hash for secure data integrity and verification.
- Steganography : Hides a message in a png image stored in the repository.
- HMAC (hash-based message authentication code) Encodes an HMAC with the given data and compares it to a given hexadecimal HMAC to guarantee authenticity.
